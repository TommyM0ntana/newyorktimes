        Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to 
        hypothesize the existence of inflation, which 
        explains how the universe expanded so uniformly 
        and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 
        13.8 billion years ago.

          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an 
          itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a 
          new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed 
          up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far 
          beyond the world of known physics. <br>

          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of 
          some exotic particles that should have been created in 
          the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made 
          the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the 
          presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
          itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, 
          causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for 
          a prodigiously violent instant. <br>
          
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like 
          why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles 
          and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be 
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean. <br>
          
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of 
          the page and drew a double box around it.  <br>
          
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers 
          reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, 
          and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, 
          looked right. <br>
          
          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first 
          sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the South Pole, 
          a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian 
          Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
          space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the signature of a 
          universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a 
          trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. 
          They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, 
          Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.  <br>
