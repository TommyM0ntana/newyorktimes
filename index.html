        Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to 
        hypothesize the existence of inflation, which 
        explains how the universe expanded so uniformly 
        and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 
        13.8 billion years ago.

          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an 
          itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a 
          new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed 
          up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far 
          beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>

        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of 
          some exotic particles that should have been created in 
          the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made 
          the universe bang to begin with. A potential hitch in the 
          presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space 
          itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, 
          causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for 
          a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>

        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like 
          why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, 
          warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles 
          and irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be 
          diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.       
        </p>

        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of 
          the page and drew a double box around it.
        </p>

        <p>
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers 
          reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, 
          and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, 
          looked right.         
        </p>

        <p>
          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a class="text-highlight" href="">the first 
          sliver of cosmic time</a>  with telescopes at the South Pole, 
          a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian 
          Center for Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of 
          space-time — so-called <a class="text-highlight" href=""> graviational waves</a> 
          — the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a 
          trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. 
          They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, 
          Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.         
        </p>

        <p>
          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, 
          though many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>

        <p>
          If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark 
          in science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy 
          pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would 
          open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, 
          extending 14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of 
          billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a 
          larger cosmos whose extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. 
          Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an endless 
          number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, 
          like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
        </p>

          ‘As Big as It Gets’
        </p>

        <p>
          In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the 
          forces operating at energies forever beyond the reach of 
          particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into 
          gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples would be the first direct 
          observation of gravitational waves, which, according to Einstein’s 
          theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, 
          an early-universe expert who was not part of the team, 
          said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
        </p>

        <p>
          He continued, “This is a signal from the very 
          earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded 
          in gravitational waves.”
        </p>

        <p>
            he ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral 
            patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that 
            permeates space and preserves a picture of the 
            universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot 
            as the surface of the sun.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an 
          experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of 
          Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported their results 
          in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics 
          here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The 
          Astrophysical Journal.
